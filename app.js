/*

Game steps

players join game then
setup game - initialize game variables
reset game - for poker means shuffle deck, post blinds, deal cards etc
pre-flop - players bet
flop - deal 3 community cards, players bet, if all players fold then skip to pay the winners
turn - deal 1 community card, players bet, if all players fold then skip to pay the winners
river - deal 1 community card, players bet, if all players fold then skip to pay the winners
showdown - show the cards
payout - pay the winners
check for game over - if all players except one are broke then game over, if game over then go to setup game
if game is not over then move the dealer button - go to reset game
